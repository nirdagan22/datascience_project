Beginning AutoGluon training...
AutoGluon will save models to '/Users/nirdagan/Desktop/datascience_project/AutogluonModels/ag-20250310_175210'
=================== System Info ===================
AutoGluon Version:  1.2
Python Version:     3.11.11
Operating System:   Darwin
Platform Machine:   arm64
Platform Version:   Darwin Kernel Version 22.6.0: Mon Apr 22 20:50:39 PDT 2024; root:xnu-8796.141.3.705.2~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T8103
CPU Count:          8
GPU Count:          0
Memory Avail:       4.76 GB / 16.00 GB (29.8%)
Disk Space Avail:   4.77 GB / 228.27 GB (2.1%)
	WARNING: Available disk space is low and there is a risk that AutoGluon will run out of disk during fit, causing an exception. 
	We recommend a minimum available disk space of 10 GB, and large datasets may require more.

train_data with frequency 'None' has been resampled to frequency 'B'.
Provided train_data has 1252 rows (NaN fraction=3.5%), 1 time series. Median time series length is 1252 (min=1252, max=1252). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'Close'
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'RMSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
